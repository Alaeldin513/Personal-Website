        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="bioSectionContainerText">
            <p>I currently work for General Motors as a mobile developer in Detroit, Michigan. I work on an iOS project that
                is built with swift, objective-c, and react-native. This project produces apps such as myChevrolet, myGMC,
                myCadillac, myBuick, and other international brands. </p>
            <p>I'm also a youtuber, I make content on programming and personal finance. The goal is to provide information to
                those whoa are starting programming for the first time or want to plan for the future. It's information that
                I believe as helped me to live a focused and minimal stress life. </p>
